        <div class="army-history">
          <p>
            The NCC in India was formed in 1948. It can be traced back to the
            ‘University Corps’, which was created under the Indian Defence Act
            1917. In 1920, when the Indian Territorial Act was passed, the
            ‘University Corps’ was replaced by the University Training Corps
            (UTC). The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
            presided over the function of raising the first NCC Unit at Delhi on
            the last Sunday of Nov. 1948. This day is traditionally celebrated
            as the 'NCC Day'. In 1949, the Girls Division was formed in order to
            provide equal opportunities to school and college-going girls. The
            Air Wing of the National Cadet Corps (NCC) was established on April
            1, 1950, with one Air Squadron each in Bombay and Kolkata. AND
            followed by the Naval Wing in 1952. Same year, the NCC curriculum
            was extended to include community development/social service
            activities as a part of the NCC syllabus at the behest of Late
            Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru who took keen interest in the growth of the
            NCC. <br /> Following the 1962 Sino-Indian War, to meet the
            requirement of the Nation, the NCC training was made compulsory in
            1963. In 1968, the Corps was again made voluntary. During
            Indo-Pakistani war of 1965 & Bangladesh-Pakistani war of 1971, NCC
            cadets were second line of defense. They organized camp to assist
            ordnance factories, supplying arms and ammunition to the front and
            also were used as patrol parties to capture enemy paratroopers. The
            NCC cadets also worked hand in hand with the Civil defence
            authorities and actively took part in rescue works and traffic
            control. After 1965 and 1971 wars NCC syllabus was revised. Rather
            than just being second line of defence, NCC syllabus laid greater
            stress on developing quality of leadership and officer like
            qualities. The military training which the NCC cadets received was
            reduced and greater importance was given to other areas like social
            service and youth management.

              take great part in it and manage it as well. The students and
              professors of college take immense part in it.
